# Let's Go Biking Project

Welcome to the Let's Go Biking project! We've developed a cycling application that integrates with the JCDecaux API for bike information and OpenRouteService for route planning. Our project comprises a heavy client with a map, a server, and a proxy cache.

## Project Components

### 1. Heavy Client with Map
Experience seamless route planning with our heavy client that features an integrated map. Get ready for an enhanced cycling adventure!

### 2. Server
Our server component efficiently manages user requests, serving as the backbone of the Let's Go Biking application.

### 3. Proxy Cache
Optimizing data retrieval is a priority for us. The proxy cache ensures improved performance by caching relevant information.

## Getting Started

To launch the Let's Go Biking project, follow these steps:

1. **Run the `launcher.bat` file:**
   - Execute this script to start both the server and the proxy components.

2. **Launch the Heavy Client:**
   - Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following Maven command to build and install dependencies:

     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```

   - After a successful build, run the main class `src/main/java/Main` to start the Heavy Client.

Now you're all set to explore Let's Go Biking with real-time bike data from JCDecaux and efficient route planning powered by OpenRouteService.
